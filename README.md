### Reusable Workflow Best Practices

- When calling any [reusable workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows), pegging the version to a specific ref/SHA is recommended. This ensures that your workflow will not break if a new version of the workflow is released which contains breaking changes. In the example below, the version is pegged to the v1.5.0 tag, but you can also use the `main` branch to always use the latest version.
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    my_job_using_foo_workflow:
      uses: Nerdware-LLC/reusable-action-workflows/.github/workflows/foo_workflow.yaml@v1.7.0 # or @main
  ```
- Provide only the necessary minimum [`permissions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) to any given workflow. For more information, see "[Automatic token authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)."

---

## [ECR Image Push](/.github/workflows/ecr_image_push.yaml)

This workflow builds a Docker image using [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) and uploads it to an ECR repo.

**Requirements:**

- You must have an existing ECR image repo.
- The calling workflow must specify an [OpenID Connect IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) ARN with which the relevant API calls can be authenticated. Support for other forms of authentication may be added in the future.

**Usage:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_using_ecr_image_push:
    uses: Nerdware-LLC/reusable-action-workflows/.github/workflows/ecr_image_push.yaml@v1.7.0 # or @main
    secrets:
      OIDC_GITHUB_ROLE_ARN: ${{ secrets.OIDC_GITHUB_ROLE_ARN }}
      AWS_ECR_PRIVATE_REPO: ${{ secrets.AWS_ECR_PRIVATE_REPO }}
      AWS_ECR_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_ECR_REGION }}
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
```

## [Get Docker Tags](/.github/workflows/get_docker_tags.yaml)

This workflow outputs a JSON-formatted array of three Docker tags which can be used in `docker build` and/or `docker tag` commands.

In order, the tags provided in the output are as follows:

1. "latest", a constant which this action always includes in the output.
2. A version tag based either on the version-tag input OR the "version" property in a package.json, if one is present.
3. A ref tag based on the variable component of the GITHUB_REF env var, the value of which depends on the type of event which triggered the Action run:

   | EVENT        | REF                           | IMAGE TAG       |
   | :----------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------- |
   | branch push  | `refs/heads/<branch_name>`    | `<branch_name>` |
   | pull request | `refs/pull/<pr_number>/merge` | `<pr_number>`   |
   | release      | `refs/tags/<release_tag>`     | `<release_tag>` |

**Usage:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_using_get_docker_tags:
    uses: Nerdware-LLC/reusable-action-workflows/.github/workflows/get_docker_tags.yaml@v1.7.0 # or @main
    with:
      tag-prefix: my-image-name # required input
      version-tag: v1.0.0 # optional input - defaults to the "version" specified in package.json
```

## [Node Test](/.github/workflows/node_test.yaml)

This workflow sets up NodeJS, runs your `test-script` (default: `test:ci`), updates the GitHub commit status, and optionally updates [CodeCov](https://about.codecov.io/). The input `env-vars` is a string formatted as a space-separated list of environment variables to be set in the workflow; this is a workaround to the limitation that [the `env` context in caller workflows is not propagated to called workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#limitations). The input `test-script` is the name of the npm script to run.

**Artifacts:**
If your `test-script` creates coverage reports at `<repo-root>/coverage`, the coverage dir will be uploaded as an artifact named `coverage-reports`. This artifact can be downloaded in a subsequent step using the [download-artifact](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact) action. To disable this behavior, set the input `should-upload-coverage-artifacts` to `false`.

**Usage:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_using_node_test:
    uses: Nerdware-LLC/reusable-action-workflows/.github/workflows/node_test.yaml@v1.7.0 # or @main
    with:
      test-script: "test:ci"
      # Note the >- below; this block-chomping indicator will rm all newline chars, and separate each line by a space.
      env-vars: >-
        MY_ENV_VAR=my-env-var-value@v1.7.0
        FOO=bar
        BAZ=qux
    secrets:
      CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }} # <-- Optional
```

## [S3 Image Upload](/.github/workflows/s3_image_upload.yaml)

This workflow builds a Docker image as a ZIP archive and then uploads it to an S3 bucket.

**Requirements:**

- You must have an existing S3 bucket with [_default SSE encryption_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html). Support for buckets encrypted with a user-managed KMS key may be added in the future.
- The calling workflow must specify an [OpenID Connect IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) ARN with which the relevant API calls can be authenticated. Support for other forms of authentication may be added in the future.

**Usage:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_using_s3_image_upload:
    uses: Nerdware-LLC/reusable-action-workflows/.github/workflows/s3_image_upload.yaml@v1.7.0 # or @main
    with:
      image-name: foo-image-name
    secrets:
      OIDC_GITHUB_ROLE_ARN: ${{ secrets.OIDC_GITHUB_ROLE_ARN }}
      S3_BUCKET_DEST: ${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_DEST }}
      S3_BUCKET_REGION: ${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_REGION }}
```

## [Semantic Release](/.github/workflows/release.yaml)

This workflow uses [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to publish a GitHub release.

**Requirements:**

- Configuration: Your repo must include a [Semantic Release config file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration).
- Authentication: You must provide an auth token granting push access to the project Git repo via a secret named `SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN`. [Semantic Release requires these permissions in order to create git tags](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication).
  - If your repo _does not_ use [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches), the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is sufficient.
  - If your repo _does_ include branch protection rules, the calling workflow must instead provide a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) granting push access to the project Git repo.

**Usage:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_using_release:
    uses: Nerdware-LLC/reusable-action-workflows/.github/workflows/release.yaml@v1.7.0 # or @main
    secrets:
      SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SEMANTIC_RELEASE_TOKEN }}
      # or "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" (see above info regarding auth requirements)
```

## [Upload to S3](/.github/workflows/upload_to_s3.yaml)

This workflow creates a NodeJS build via `npm run build`, and then uploads the resultant package to an S3 bucket using the [`aws s3 sync`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/sync.html) command.

**Requirements:**

- Your project's repo root must include a `package.json` file with a defined `build` script.
- You must have an existing S3 bucket with [_default SSE encryption_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html). Support for buckets encrypted with a user-managed KMS key may be added in the future.
- The calling workflow must specify an [OpenID Connect IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html) ARN with which the relevant API calls can be authenticated. Support for other forms of authentication may be added in the future.

**Usage:**

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job_using_upload_to_s3:
    uses: Nerdware-LLC/reusable-action-workflows/.github/workflows/upload_to_s3.yaml@v1.7.0 # or @main
    with:
      s3-sync-command-params: "--acl bucket-owner-full-control --sse AES256"
      # The above s3-sync command params would be sufficient for a bucket with default SSE encryption
      # and standard ACL protections. For more info on s3-sync command options, see the documentation
      # at https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3/sync.html#options
    secrets:
      OIDC_GITHUB_ROLE_ARN: ${{ secrets.OIDC_GITHUB_ROLE_ARN }}
      S3_BUCKET_REGION: ${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET_REGION }}
      S3_UPLOAD_PATH: ${{ secrets.S3_UPLOAD_PATH }} # my_foo_bucket/production
```
